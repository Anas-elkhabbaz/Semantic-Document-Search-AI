Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Examples include:
- Classification: Predicting categories (e.g., spam detection)
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices)

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data:
- Clustering: Grouping similar items together
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features

3. Neural Networks
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks:
- Layers of interconnected nodes (neurons)
- Each connection has a weight that adjusts during training
- Deep learning uses networks with many layers

4. Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

5. Model Evaluation
Key metrics for evaluating models:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

6. Applications
Machine learning is used in:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Autonomous vehicles

Conclusion:
Machine learning continues to revolutionize technology and industry, with new applications emerging daily.
